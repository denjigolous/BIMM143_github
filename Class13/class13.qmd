# Section 1. Differential Expression Analysis

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
```

Load the data files

```{r}
metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)
```

```{r}
# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

> Q. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from countData

```{r}
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```

Check that my metadata and count data match

```{r}
rownames(colData)
```

```{r}
colnames(countData)
```

```{r}
rownames(colData)==colnames(countData)
```

```{r}
all(rownames(colData) == colnames(countData))
```

This looks better but there are lots of zero entries in there so let's get rid of them as we have no data for these.

> Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

```{r}
#head(countData)
to.keep <- rowSums(countData) != 0
countData <- countData[to.keep,]

nrow(countData)
head(countData)
```

## Run DESeq2

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
head(colData)
```

Set up the object that DESeq needs for analysis with the lovely log function, and run DESeq analysis

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```

```{r}
dds
res <- results(dds)
res
```

Next, get results for the HoxA1 knockdown versus control siRNA (remember that these were labeled as "hoxa1_kd" and "control_sirna" in our original colData metaFile input to DESeq, you can check this above and by running resultsNames(dds) command).

```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```

> Q. Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.

```{r}
summary(res)
```

4349 upregulated, 4396 downregulated

## Volcono Plot

```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

```{r}
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
abline(v=c(-2,2), lty=2)
```

## Adding Gene Annotation

Since we mapped and counted against the Ensembl annotation, our results only have information about Ensembl gene IDs. However, our pathway analysis downstream will use KEGG pathways, and genes in KEGG pathways are annotated with Entrez gene IDs. So lets add them as we did the last day.

> Q. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```

> Q. Finally for this section let's reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, "deseq_results.csv")
```

# Section 2 Pathway Analysis

## KEGG Pathways

Now we can load the packages and setup the KEGG data-sets we need.

```{r}
library(pathview)
```

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in `res$entrez`) and we have the fold change results from DESeq2 analysis (stored in `res$log2FoldChange`).

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now, let's run the gage pathway analysis.

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

Now lets look at the object returned from gage().

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)
```

Each `keggres$less` and `keggres$greater` object is data matrix with gene sets as rows sorted by p-value.

The top "less/down" pathways is "Cell cycle" with the KEGG pathway identifier hsa04110.

Now, let's try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color. To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa04110 Cell cycle") that we could see from the print out above.

```{r, message=FALSE}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

```{r, message=FALSE}
# A different PDF based output of the same data
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110", kegg.native=FALSE)
```

Now, let's process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the pathway IDs needed by the pathview() function. We'll use these KEGG pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.

```{r}
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

```{r, message=FALSE}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```

![](hsa04640.pathview.png)\
![](hsa04630.pathview.png)\
![](hsa00140.pathview.png)\
![](hsa04142.pathview.png)\
![](hsa04330.pathview.png)

# Section 3 Gene Ontology

We can also do a similar procedure with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms. go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF ontologies. Let's focus on BP (a.k.a Biological Process) here.

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

# Section 4 Reactome Analysis

Reactome is database consisting of biological molecules and their relation to pathways and processes. Let's now conduct over-representation enrichment analysis and pathway-topology analysis with Reactome using the previous list of significant genes generated from our differential expression results above.

First, Using R, output the list of significant genes at the 0.05 level as a plain text file:

```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length(sig_genes)))
```

```{r}
write.table(sig_genes, file="significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

> Q: What pathway has the most significant "Entities p-value"? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

Signal transduction and gene expression has the most significant pathway.
